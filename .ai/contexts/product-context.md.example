# Holus Product Context

> This file provides product and business context to all AI agents. Update it as your product evolves.

## Overview

Holus is **Personal AI Agent Workforce for local-first automation.**.

**Vision:** Ship reliable AI-assisted workflows with measurable outcomes and strong operational safety

## Target Users

**Primary Audience:** Product builders, operators, and AI-assisted contributors

**User Personas:**
- Primary user: Personal AI Agent Workforce for local-first automation.
- Operator user: Personal AI Agent Workforce for local-first automation.

## Core Problem

**Problem Statement:**
Reduces manual delivery work while improving consistency and reliability

**Current Solution (if any):**
Manual workflows, ad-hoc scripts, and fragmented documentation

**Why This Matters:**
Faster iteration, fewer regressions, and predictable operations

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Python + LangChain/LangGraph
- **Language:** Python
- **Database:** ChromaDB
- **Key Dependencies:**
  - Runtime and framework dependencies - Store canonical workflow state
  - Data and integration dependencies - Store canonical workflow state

## Domain Entities

Core concepts in this project:

| Entity | Description | Key Fields |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| Primary domain entity | Personal AI Agent Workforce for local-first automation. | id, status, created_at, updated_at |
| Workflow execution entity | Personal AI Agent Workforce for local-first automation. | id, status, created_at, updated_at |
| Audit/log entity | Personal AI Agent Workforce for local-first automation. | id, status, created_at, updated_at |

**Entity Relationships:**
```
Primary domain entity
  ├── has many Workflow execution entity
  └── belongs to Audit/log entity
```

## External Dependencies

### Primary API provider (e.g., Stripe)
- **Purpose:** Enable core business workflows and automation
- **Key Operations:** Deploy specialized AI agents on local machine for 24/7 personal assistance.
- **Constraints:** Respect provider limits and cost ceilings

### Secondary integrations (e.g., SendGrid)
- **Purpose:** Enable core business workflows and automation
- **Key Operations:** Deploy specialized AI agents on local machine for 24/7 personal assistance.
- **Constraints:** Respect provider limits and cost ceilings

## Key Constraints

- **Performance:** Interactive paths under 2s where possible
- **Scale:** Designed for current project demand with room to scale
- **Compliance:** Handle PII and credentials according to platform policies
- **Budget:** Keep cloud and API spend within approved budget
- **Technical:** Constrained by third-party APIs and local environment differences

## Development Phases

### MVP (0-8 weeks)
**Goal:** Ship a reliable core workflow end-to-end

**Scope:**
- Core data flow and persistence
- Primary user-facing operation
- Monitoring and error handling

**Success Criteria:**
- Workflow success rate > 95%
- Median execution time within target SLO

### V1.5 (8-16 weeks)
**Goal:** Expand automation and observability

**Scope:**
- Advanced reporting/analytics
- Operational automation hooks

### V2 (16+ weeks)
**Goal:** Scale with stronger reliability guarantees

## Product-Specific Patterns

Prefer explicit interfaces and typed contracts

Example:
- Every Primary domain entity MUST have id
- Workflow execution entity creation requires validation via Primary API provider
- All Audit/log entity operations are atomic transactions

## How to Update This File

- Update when product vision changes
- Update when adding new domain entities
- Update when changing tech stack
- Update at major milestones (MVP shipped, V1.5 complete)
