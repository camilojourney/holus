## Example

```markdown
# Week of Jan 27, 2026

## 🚀 Shipped
- Comparison dashboard - users can now compare two versions side by side with highlighted differences
- Performance improvements - record loading is now 40% faster

## 📊 Numbers
- 50 new workflows saved this week
- 3x more diff views than last week
- 0 critical bugs (knock on wood)

## 💡 Learned
Talked to 5 users this week. The #1 pain point is still forgetting which settings produced good results. Intent field adoption is at 80% - people are actually using it! 

Need to make comparison mode more discoverable for first-time users.

## 🔮 Next Up
- Outcome tagging (success/failure/needs follow-up)
- Search by purpose
- Mobile-friendly dashboard
```
