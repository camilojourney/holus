## 📊 Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Planned (P0) | 4 tasks |
| Shipped (P0) | 4 tasks |
| Velocity | 100% |
| Total commits | 18 across 4 repos |
| Repos touched | 4/5 (holus, social-media-auto, content_ai, invoz) |
| Blockers | 0 |

## 🔍 What We Learned

1. **Day 1 velocity was exceptional** — 18 commits across 4 repos. This pace won't sustain, but it set strong foundations.
2. **Invoz surprised** — Wasn't in original P0 but got a full pipeline sprint. Good output, but watch for scope creep.
3. **content_ai_generation commits have malformed messages** — Need to enforce commit message standards for workers.
4. **MCP wrapper is a stub** — Ships the interface but needs real implementation. That's fine for Day 1.
5. **Manager/Worker system is documented before built** — Good discipline. APPROACH_v1 will guide actual implementation.

## 🎯 Tomorrow's Plan

1. **Genpelli MCP server** — Next integration piece (P1, 4h est)
2. **Connect Genpelli → Social Media Auto** — The pipeline that makes content flow (P1, 4h est)
3. **Invoz: filler word detection** — Build on today's prosody work (P1.5, 4h est)

## ⚠️ Watch Items
- Reachout had zero activity — don't let it fall behind
- content_ai commit quality needs attention
- Invoz scope expanding fast — keep it focused on core metrics
