## 🔍 What We Learned
- Day 2 maintained 100% velocity on active tasks — momentum is real
- All P0 items were already done from Day 1; today was all P1 work shipping
- Cross-repo integrations (Genpelli→Social, MCP servers) are the high-leverage moves
- Invoz research is progressing steadily with paper collection
- Logging infra across repos pays off — visibility into all repos from one place

## 🎯 Tomorrow's Plan
1. **Manager Agent web research** — Give Holus manager the ability to research/synthesize from web
2. **Invoz: filler word detection** — Start on P1.5 voice features
3. **Landing page for Holus** — Marketing asset, quick win

## 💡 Process Notes
- The AM build + midday QA + PM retro cadence is working well
- 5 repos all saw activity today — good breadth
- No blockers encountered — keep this going
