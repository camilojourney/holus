# AI Development Playbooks

Phase-based workflow for reliable AI-assisted delivery.

## Systems

- `docs/playbooks/`: guided human-in-the-loop execution
- `.ai/`: autonomous operation with standards and escalation boundaries

## Phases

1. `1-spec-create.md` - define clear, testable requirements
2. `2-spec-review.md` - remove ambiguity before coding
3. `3-implement.md` - implement specs with tests
4. `4-audit-logic.md` - adversarial logic and security review
5. `5-audit-intent.md` - validate user intent and UX fit
6. `6-fix-iterate.md` - apply minimal targeted fixes

For bug-only work use `hotfix.md`.
