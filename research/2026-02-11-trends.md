# Trend Scan: 2026-02-11

## AI Agents & MCP
AI agents are shifting to autonomous 'digital coworkers' handling long-running tasks like full app builds (Anthropic 2026 report). Multi-agent systems focus on coordination for enterprise workflows (Google Cloud, Microsoft). MCP (Model Context Protocol, Anthropic Nov 2024) has exploded: multimodal (image/video/audio), async ops, chunked streams; adopted by Red Hat OpenShift, AWS Bedrock, Cursor IDE. Linux Foundation stewardship; predicted 2026 dominant standard replacing custom agents. A2A (Google) competes.

ArXiv: Moltbook (AI agent social platform Jan 2026); privacy management agents; self-evolving agents.
