# Holus Challenger Daily Review — 2026-02-10 (7pm)

## Status: ✅ ON TRACK

All P0 tasks shipped. 100% velocity. Day 1 was exceptional — 18 commits across 4 repos.

## Minor Flags (Monitor)

1. **Commit Message Quality** — content_ai_generation has malformed commits. Establish worker commit standards (emoji + subject or enforce format).

2. **Reachout Silence** — Zero activity today. Don't let this project slip. Reschedule or assign next sprint task.

3. **Invoz Scope** — Wasn't in original P0 but got a full pipeline sprint today. Good output, but watch for creep. Keep focused on core metrics (pitch, volume, rate, pauses, prosody).

## Tomorrow's Plan (Pre-Approved)

1. Genpelli MCP server (P1, 4h)
2. Genpelli → Social Media Auto pipeline (P1, 4h)
3. Invoz: filler word detection (P1.5, 4h)

## Lessons from Day 1

- Manager/Worker documented before built — good discipline
- MCP stub approach works well for Day 1 → iterate
- Dashboard v1 provides visibility — extend with metrics
- 18 commits is unsustainable pace, but direction is solid
